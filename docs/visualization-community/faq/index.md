KeyWord(s): VisCom (Visualization Community)

**What is Visualization Community?**
* [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can explore public research visualizations, learn to use [ProteinPaint](https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/)/[GenomePaint](https://genomepaint.stjude.cloud/) to create your own visualizations, and even create visualizations that can be privately or publicly accessed.

**How does Visualization Community work?**
* VisCom is hosted in St. Jude's cloud enviornment where there is no outsource program or application to download. It only requires a computer and internet connection and is completely free for non-profit/academic use.

* You will ***not*** incur any costs except in the following situations:

*When data driving a visualization is stored in St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform or DNAnexus, a monthly fee will be incurred for storage costs. See your [DNAnexus billing information](https://platform.dnanexus.com/profile/settings/billing) for the cost per GB.*

**What do the visualizations represent?**
* The visuals are curated by researchers, those composed of St Jude Cloud or others within a research team. These visuals represent high dimensional proteomic or genomic data sets. 

**Can I create my own visualizations?**
* Yes, St. Jude internal users have access to create visuals now once they sign up for an account and are assigned a team. We are working on a new workflow so that you can create visuals without being on a team. 
* As an external user, please contact support@stjude.cloud so that we can help you create an account. Then, you may follow our **Getting Started** chapter to follow step-by-step tutorials to begin creating your own visualizations within VisCom.

**Can I share my visuals with others?**
* Yes, you may share your visualization(s) if our PI or team lead approves. We can enable a feature for you to share the direct link administratively if the visualization is still private. Coming soon will be a sharing option within the Visualization Community platform once the visualization is public. 

**Can I keep my visualizations private?**
* Yes, we have an access control workflow where you can create visualizations which will remain private until you get approval from the team P.I. or Team Lead to to make it public. 

**Can I use these in a publication?**
* Yes, you may use these sophisticated figures in your publications. We currently have published visualizations in over 11 prestigious journals including Nature, Cancer Discovery, Blood, and Cell Reports. 

**Do I have to upload my own PDF or what do I need to generate the interactive visualization?**
* You do not need to upload a PDF. You can either use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint to create a visual. While we have curated examples, custom content is allowed. 

**Can I access the data used to generate the visualizations?** 
* You can access the data within each Community on the 'Data tab' or by clicking the data source icon above each individual visualization.

**What is a community?**
* A community is a platform within VisCom that allows teams (and/or multiple users) to share visualizations related to the same research. 

* For example, Audacious Goals Initiative (AGI) - Retina provides a platform about retinal diseases that highlight studies and research across multiple labs. Not only are the labs studies showcased, but the data supporting the visualizations are accessible. 

* This platform can be empowering to share data, showcase visualizations, and propel discoveries. All communities have a logo and description that is tailored for that communityâ€™s initiative. 

* Please email support@stjude.cloud that you are interested in creating a community. Our admin team will reach out with the next steps. In general, we will want to set up an interview to understand your research and how you develop your data. Then, we will begin to roadmap the project so that we can get your branding (logo, description, and necessary data) completed. We will need access to your studies (publications, abstracts, etc) and then our team will work on how to get your visualizations in VisCom by providing one-on-one assistance, including a demonstration so that you can also develop visualizations on your own.


**What is a collection?**
* A collection is a setting where a user or team can group a set of visualizations to be viewed together. For example, a user may want to group a cohort of visualizations by data type or disease. 

* The collection will display as shown here. A collection can remain public, private, or private but with a direct link. 

* This can be a way to share visualizations in bulk by using our direct link setting, if all visualizations remain private. Or this is a way to share a collection of visualizations publicly for a direct purpose. 

* Please email support@stjude.cloud with the list of visualizations you want grouped into a collection, including a description for the landing page. If they are private, a direct link will be given to share with others or for individual use.
