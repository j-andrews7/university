KeyWord(s): VizCom (Visualization Community)

**What is Visualization Community?**
* [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can navigate published research visualizations and learn to use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint to create and share your own visualizations. Once you find the visualization you need, you can easily re-create it utilizing innovative tools and then display the data dynamically for a streamlined experience.

**What does it offer?**
* VizCom allows you to create, explore, and visualize data effortlessly. We encourage you to write less code and create more discoveries. 

**Does Visualization Community cost anything?**
* VizCom is hosted in St. Jude's cloud enviornment where there is no outsource program or application to download. It only requires a computer and internet connection.

* You will ***not*** incur any costs except in the following situations:

* When data driving a visualization is stored in St. Jude Cloud Genomics Platform or DNAnexus, a monthly fee will be incurred for storage costs. See your [DNAnexus billing information](https://platform.dnanexus.com/profile/settings/billing) for the cost per GB.

**What do the visualizations represent?**
* The visuals are curated by researchers, those composed of St Jude Cloud or others within a team. These visuals can be searched by Lab, Research Domain, Data type. Coming soon will be Communities where visuals are grouped by study and the affiliated publications. These visuals are sophisticated and were created by St. Jude Tools called Protein Paint/Genome Paint.

**Can I create my own visualizations?**
* Yes, St. Jude internal users have access to create visuals now once they sign up for an account and are assigned a team. We are working on a wizard so you can create visuals without being on a team. 
* As an external user, you may follow our COMING SOON 'Visualize Your Data' Chapter to follow step-by-step tutorials.

**Can I share my visuals with others?**
* Yes, you may share your visualization once createdd. Coming soon will be a sharing option within the Visualization Community platform. 

**Can I keep my visualizations private?**
* Yes, we have an access control workflow where you can create visualizations and keep those private. Or, you may go through a workflow to get a visualization published within our platform. 

**Can I use these in a publication?**
* Yes, you may use these sophisticated images in your publications.

**Do I have to upload my own PDF or what do I need to generate the interactive visualization?**
* You do not need to upload a PDF. You can either use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint as an internal user or follow our step-by-step to create a visual and have a html output.
* While we have curated examples, custom content is allowed. 

**Can I access the data used to generate the visualizations?** 
* You can access the data within each Community on the 'Data tab' or by clicking the data source icon above each individual visualization.

**Can I build a Community?**
* Yes, you can curate a public or private Community to unify the visualizations and publications that are associated to propel the scientific community.
