St. Jude Cloud's [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can navigate published research visualizations and learn to use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint to create and share your own visualizations. Once you find the visualization you need, you can easily re-create it utilizing innovative tools and then display the data dynamically for a streamlined experience.

## Purpose
* By utilizing St. Jude's visualization tools [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/), we allow world class genomic or epigenomic visualizations to be easily developed, accessed, and/or shared globally.

* You can explore the shared visualizations by [Data type](/docs/visualization-community/datatypes/index.md/Supporteddatatypes/), [Tool](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools), Research Domain, or by chronological order of publication.

## Goals
* Create sophisticated visualizations ***without being a computational scientist or engineer***
* Unravel discoveries to accelerate live-saving research ***based on the visual analysis***
* Collaborate with others ***by exploring and sharing visualizations within a community or team***

## Support
* [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) is developed & supported by [Xin Xhaos's group](https://www.stjude.org/directory/z/xin-zhou.html)

* Visualization Community is developed by the St. Jude Cloud team to facilitate scientific research using St. Jude-developed visualization tools.
