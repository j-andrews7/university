title: Visualization Community

St. Jude Cloud's [Visualization Community](https://viz.stjude.cloud/) is a safe environment where you can explore curated visualizations, learn to use ProteinPaint/GenomePaint to create your own visualizations, and/or host visualizations within a team that can be shared publicly or remain private. 

Once you find the visualization you need, you can easily re-create it utilizing innovative tools and then display the data dynamically for a streamlined experience.

## Purpose
* By utilizing St. Jude's visualization tools [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/), we allow world class genomic or proteomic visualizations to be easily developed, accessed, and/or shared globally.

* You can explore the shared visualizations by [Data type](/docs/visualization-community/datatypes/index.md/Supporteddatatypes/), [Tool](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools), Research Domain, or by chronological order of publication. 

* We even offer Communities to share and unify research within a genre of research. 

## Goals
* Create sophisticated visualizations ***without being a computational scientist or engineer***
* Unravel discoveries to accelerate life-saving research ***based on the visual analysis***
* Collaborate with others ***by exploring and sharing visualizations within a community or team***

## Support
* [ProteinPaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/proteinpaint/) and [GenomePaint](https://viz.stjude.cloud/tools/genomepaint/) is developed & supported by [Xin Zhou's group](https://www.stjude.org/directory/z/xin-zhou.html)

* Visualization Community is developed by the St. Jude Cloud team to facilitate scientific research using St. Jude-developed visualization tools.
